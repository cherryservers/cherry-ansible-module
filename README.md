Cherry Servers ansible module 
=============================

WARNING
-------

Beware, this module has been obsoleted by [Cherry Servers Ansible collection ](https://github.com/cherryservers/ansible-collection-cherryservers).

Introduction
------------

Cherry Servers is an international Bare Metal Cloud provider and supports the following Ansible modules:

* __cherryservers_sshkey__: manages public SSH keys on Client Portal. You may assign these keys to your chosen servers upon deployment.
* __cherryservers_ips__: manages floating IPs at Client Portal. You may order additional IPs, route them to existing servers, etc.
* __cherryservers_server__: manages servers at Cherry Servers. You may Deploy and Terminate servers, manage theyr power, etc.

Installation
------------

In order to use above mentioned modules you need to download files from [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/cherryservers/cherry_ansible_module) , put them into folder named **library** and move it to your ansible playbooks directory, for instance:

```
└── cherry_servers_playbooks
    ├── library
    │   ├── cherryservers_ips.py
    │   ├── cherryservers_server.py
    │   └── cherryservers_sshkey.py
    ├── servers_deploy.yml
    └── servers_terminate.yml
```

Requirements
------------

The Cherry Servers module connects to Cherry Servers Public API via [cherry-python](https://pypi.org/project/cherry-python/) package. You need to install it with __pip__:

```
$ pip install cherry-python
```

In order to use Ansible module you will need to export Cherry Servers API token. You can generate and get it from your Client Portal. The easiest way is to export variable like this:

```
$ export CHERRY_AUTH_TOKEN="2b00042f7481c7b056c4b410d28f33cf"
```

Most of the time you will need several UUIDs or specific names to work with those modules:

* __project_id__ - you will need to specify it to work with all modules. You can find that ID by looging to Cherry Servers Client Portal.
* __plan_id__ - you will need to specify it to work with cherryservers_server module.
* __image__ - you will need to specify it to work with cherryservers_server module.
* __region__ - you will need to specify it to work with cherryservers_server and cherryservers_ips module.
